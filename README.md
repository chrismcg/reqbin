# ReqBin

A very simple app for displaying JSON requests locally. Uses Phoenix LiveView to display the requests as they come in. Useful when debugging something that sends JSON to an endpoint e.g. a background job or event.

## Running

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
